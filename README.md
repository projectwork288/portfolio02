# Portfolio

This was a difficult program. I probably got too caught up in making it right. I'm pleased with the final result.

I did not include a photo or graphic of myself. I know it was a requirement but I have a hangup about my own picture. I'm not very photogenic.

I didn't know much about esthetics so I chose my favorite color; green, as a back ground color. The photos I choose are driven from the details in the Personal Bio section below the header. (Navy, Travel, Hiking, Dogs)

There is a sidebar that will navigate to the Programs I write in the future. I donâ€™t have any yet. I put links to Google, Ike and National Parks as place holders to show the transition.
